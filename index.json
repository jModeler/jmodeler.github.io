This was the command I used: pip3 install git+https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl --pre From this page, I learnt about using the --use-deprecated option, but that did not work too. This was the command I used: pip3 install git+https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver Going back to the minerl install page, I checked the Java version, hoping that this was the issue: $ java -version openjdk version \u0026#34;14.0.2\u0026#34; 2020-07-14 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 14.0.2+12-46) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.2+12-46, mixed mode, sharing) My system was using the wrong version of Java!

These results are from Chapter 3 of Taleb (2020).\nIn the world of thin tails (i.e. data that are Gaussian distributed), as the sample of data gets larger, no single data point can change the properties of the entire sample (Taleb calls this “Mediocristan”). Conversely, in data from fat tailed distributions (i.e. data from a distribution whose tail decays like a power law), a single data point (or rare events) can disproportionately impact the properties of a sample (Taleb calls this “Extremistan”). The next section explores data from a standard normal distribution, and how likely it is to observe a tail event in such data.\nGaussian Data (Mediocristan) Summary: In data that are normally (Gaussian) distributed, it is more likely to observe several smaller “bad” events that one massive “tail” event. For insurability, the losses need to come from many smaller bad events than a single tail event. This is true in the case of Gaussian data.\nTaleb gives the example of checking the total height of two individuals randomly drawn from a sample of people (the heights are assumed to be normally distributed, or our sample is from Mediocristan). If the total height is 4.1m, (a tail event), it is more likely that the individual heights are 2.05m each than one being 10cm and the other being 4m.\nMathematically stated, if \\(X\\) is a large value generated from a Gaussian distribution (Mediocristan), it is more likely to observe a value greater than this twice, than observing a random value that is greater than \\(2X\\). Let us verify this by drawing a few sample values from the standard normal distribution.\nimport scipy.stats as dist # standard normal distribution st_norm = dist.norm(0,1) # get the probability of observing a value that is more than 3 standard # deviations away from the mean, i.e. 3 p_x = 1 - st_norm.cdf(3) # get the probability of observing a value that is more than 6 = 3*2 standard # deviations away from the mean p_2x = 1 - st_norm.cdf(6) # print the probability of values print(\u0026#34;Probability of observing two values that are 3 standard deviations away\\ from the mean: {0:.3E}\u0026#34;.format(p_x * p_x)) ## Probability of observing two values that are 3 standard deviations away from the mean: 1.822E-06 print(\u0026#34;Probability of observing a single value that is 6 standard deviations\\ away from the mean: {0:.3E}\u0026#34;.format(p_2x)) ## Probability of observing a single value that is 6 standard deviations away from the mean: 9.866E-10 As expected, in the Gaussian world, it is more likely to observe a series of smaller tail events, than a single large tail event, that modifies the properties of the data sample. If these tail events are associated with losses, then for insurability, the losses need to come from many (smaller) events than a single (large) one, which leads to financial ruin. The formal conditions for this were discussed in Cramér (1959).\nData from a Pareto Distribution (Extremistan) Summary: In data that are from subexponential distributions (like the pareto), it is more likely to observe one massive “tail” event than several smaller “bad” events. These are not insurable, since there is a risk of catastrophe.\nLet’s repeat the probability calculation exercise we did earlier, but now for the pareto distribution:\n# set the shape parameter for the pareto distribution b = 3 # get the pareto distribution object from dist, alias for scipy.stats st_pareto = dist.pareto(b) # get the probability of observing a value that is thrice the mean, i.e. 4.5 p_x = 1 - st_pareto.cdf(4.5) # get the probability of observing a value that is 6 times the mean, i.e. 9 p_2x = 1 - st_pareto.cdf(9) # print the probability of values print(\u0026#34;Probability of observing two values that are thrice the mean: {0:.3E}\u0026#34;.format(p_x * p_x)) ## Probability of observing two values that are thrice the mean: 1.204E-04 print(\u0026#34;Probability of observing a single value that is 6 times the mean: {0:.3E}\u0026#34;.format(p_2x)) ## Probability of observing a single value that is 6 times the mean: 1.372E-03 Note that the pareto() method in scipy takes the shape parameter b as input, as explained here.\nAs we can see, the probability of observing a single large tail event is higher than observing a series of smaller tail events. If large tail events are considered to be bad and lead to financial ruin, this makes such cases uninsurable.\nTo drive the point home, Taleb gives another example of checking the total income of two individuals randomly drawn from a sample of people (the incomes are assumed to be subexponentially distributed, or our sample is from Extremistan). If the total income is $36 Million, (a tail event), it is more likely that the individual incomes are $35,999,000 and $1000 than both incomes being $18 Million each.\nReferences Cramér, Harald. 1959.

While approximating integrals with MC methods are simpler to implement, they might lead to integral values with considerable simulation error (Skrainka and Judd 2011). This post attempts to demonstrate the claim in Skrainka and Judd (2011) using two very simple integrals, to which we already know the value. I attempt to compare the outcomes from using MC and SG.\nThe integrals I’ll be evaluating are:\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i \\right) dF_{X} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\]\nand \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{5} x_i^2 \\right) dF_{X} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{5}\\) is a five dimensional random variable, which is distributed according to the multivariate standard normal: \\[ X \\sim N\\left( \\left[ \\begin{array} {r} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right], \\left[ \\begin{array} {rrrrr} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right] \\right) \\]\nGiven the distribution of \\(X\\), the values of the integrals above are easily obtained from standard results (the value of (1) is \\(0\\) and that of (2) is \\(1\\)) respectively.\nI write some utility functions in R to compute the integrands above:\n#function to compute the sum of components of the random vector s \u0026lt;- function(x) { return(sum(x)) } #function to compute the square product of the components of the random vector p \u0026lt;- function(x) { return(prod(x^2)) } I now write a function that:\nSimulates a certain number of draws from the distribution of the random variable \\(X\\) Computes the integrand function using each of these draws as input Takes the average of the values computed in the previous step This function, in effect, would give us the approximate value of the integral via MC methodology.\nThe code is provided below, note that I use the mvtnorm package to create random draws.\nlibrary(mvtnorm) #Function to calculate the MC approximation for the integral mc_int \u0026lt;- function(s, n, mu, sigma) { #generate random draws x \u0026lt;- rmvnorm(n, mean = mu, sigma = sigma) #now get the integral mc_int_n \u0026lt;- mean(apply(x, 1, s)) return(mc_int_n) } set.seed(100) n \u0026lt;- 1000 mc_val \u0026lt;- mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) mc_val ## [1] 0.007150433 The result, 0.00715 is not far off from the true value of \\(0\\) at first glance, however, we need to compare this to the result from the SG approach.\nR has a package that generates sparse grids for numerical integration as described in Heiss and Winschel (2008), called SparseGrid. We now use the nodes and weights generated from this package to approximate the first integral. I re-use some of the code provided in the documentation for the SparseGrid package in R.\nlibrary(SparseGrid) #generate sparse grids for a 5 dimensional RV with accuracy level 2 sg \u0026lt;- createSparseGrid(type=\u0026#39;KPN\u0026#39;, dimension=5, k=2) sg_int \u0026lt;- function(func, sg, ...) { gx \u0026lt;- apply(sg$nodes, 1, function(x) {func(x, ...)}) return(sum(gx * sg$weights)) } sg_val \u0026lt;- sg_int(s, sg) sg_val ## [1] 0 The result here is exactly 0. In light of this finding, the value obtained from the MC approach, in comparison, is a little off, and tends to show a high variance in output:\nset.seed(100) mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.007150433 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.03162326 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] -0.1287932 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.01040134 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] -0.03798655 In the third case, there is a \\(-12\\%\\) error(!) in the value of the computed integral when compared to the result from the SG approach. The SG approach, in addition, shows no such variation in repeated runs, since the grid values and weights are fixed for a given accuracy level and dimension (of the variable being integrated).\nI repeat the calculations for the second integral, as shown below\nMC approach:\nset.seed(100) n \u0026lt;- 1000 mc_val \u0026lt;- mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) mc_val ## [1] 1.001089 SG approach:\n#generate sparse grids for a 5 dimensional RV with accuracy level 6 sg \u0026lt;- createSparseGrid(type=\u0026#39;KPN\u0026#39;, dimension=5, k=6) sg_val \u0026lt;- sg_int(p, sg) sg_val ## [1] 1 Once again, the SG approach gives us an exact value (note that the value of \\(k\\), the accuracy level, has gone up, since the integrand is a higher order function).

At a very abstract level, given a system of equations for which a solution is needed, we convert this system to one whose solution we already know (or is easy to find out), and then bend this system till we get the solution to the original set of equations. These methods have very broad applications (Garcia and Zangwill 1981), and have been applied in the context of finding equlibria in Static Games (Bajari et al. 2010) and Dynamic Games (Borkovsky, Doraszelski, and Kryukov 2010).\nExample 1: Linear System Say we want to find the solution to the following system of linear equations: \\[\\begin{align} \\left[ \\begin{array} {rrrrr} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \\\\ 3 \u0026amp; 4 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right] \\left[ \\begin{array} {r} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 5 \\\\ 11 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\tag{1} \\end{align}\\]\nReaders should very easily be able to verify that the unique solution to this system is \\[ (x_1,x_2) = (1,2) \\]\nLet’s convert this system and introduce an additional parameter \\(t\\), called the homotopy parameter, which varies from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Let’s call this new system \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) \\[\\begin{align} \\left[ \\begin{array} {rr} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \\\\ 3 \u0026amp; 4 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right] \\left[ \\begin{array} {r} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 5t \\\\ 11t \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\tag{2} \\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(t=0\\), \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\) yields the trivial (and only) solution \\((x_1,x_2) = (0,0)\\). When \\(t=1\\), we get our original system of equations back. When we solve for \\((x_1, x_2)\\) as a function of \\(t\\), we get: \\[ (x_1(t),x_2(t)) = (t,2t) \\] At \\(t=1\\), this will give us the solution we desire. Tracing the path of the solution gives us the following plots: From this very simple example, we note that the general process followed is given below (Garcia and Zangwill 1981):\nConvert the system of equations into one that has a known solution (i.e. \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\) case above) Introduce a new parameter \\(t\\), that gives the known system at \\(t=0\\) and the system for which the solutions are desired when \\(t=1\\) Trace the path of the solutions by changing the value of \\(t\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\) Example 2: Nonlinear System Consider the following system of equations (from chapter 1, exercise 6 of (Garcia and Zangwill 1981)): \\[\\begin{align} F(x_1, x_2) = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} e^{2 x_1} - x^{2}_{2} + 3 \\\\ 4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} - x^{3}_{2} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\tag{3} \\\\ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\ F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2 \\end{align}\\]\nAgain, readers should verify that the solutions to this system of equations are \\((x1, x2) = (0, -2) \\, \\\u0026amp; \\, (x1, x2) = (0, 2)\\).\nWe now introduce the homotopy parameter \\(t\\), and define \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) as:\n\\[\\begin{align} H(x_1, x_2, t) = F(x_1, x_2) - (1-t)F(0, 0) \\tag{4} \\end{align}\\]\nThe formulation in (4) is called the Newton Homotopy (Garcia and Zangwill 1981). A distinct advantage of this formulation, is that at \\(t=0\\), it is easy to see that the solution to the system is \\((0, 0)\\).\nFor any \\(t\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) becomes: \\[\\begin{align} \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} e^{2 x_1} - x^{2}_{2} + 4t - 1 \\\\ 4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} - x^{3}_{2} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align}\\]\nWe now attempt to find \\((x_1, x_2)\\) as functions of \\(t\\). From (5), we have: \\[\\begin{align} x_{2}^{3} = 4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} \\nonumber \\\\ x_2 = 0 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, OR \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, x_{2} = \\pm 2e^{x_1} \\tag{6} \\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(x_2 = 0\\), putting this back in (5) we get: \\[\\begin{align} e^{2 x_1} + 4t - 1 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} log(1-4t) \\tag{7} \\\\ where \\,\\,\\,\\, 0 \\le t \\le 1/4 \\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(x_2 = \\pm 2e^{x_1}\\), putting this back in (5) we get: \\[\\begin{align} -3e^{2 x_1} + 4t - 1 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} log\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right) \\tag{8} \\\\ where \\,\\,\\,\\, 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\le 1 \\end{align}\\]\nCombining all the findings from (6), (7) and (8), we get: \\[\\begin{align} x_1(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2} log(1-4t) \u0026amp; \\text{for } 0\\le t \\le 1/4\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} log\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right) \u0026amp; \\text{for } 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\leq 1 \\end{cases} \\tag{9} \\\\ x_1(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\text{for } 0\\le t \\le 1/4\\\\ \\pm 2 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right)} \u0026amp; \\text{for } 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\leq 1 \\end{cases} \\tag{10} \\end{align}\\]\nWhich gives us the solution to the system of equations in (3) at \\(t = 1\\). However, note that the functions \\(x_1(t), x_2(t)\\) are non-differentiable, which disqualifies them from being solution paths (Garcia and Zangwill 1981). This is evident in the plots shown below: One could always try another formulation for \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) which leads to well defined paths to the desired solution from the known solution (i.e. the solution to \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\)). That is left as an exercise to the …","date":1679270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679312630,"objectID":"425a3588c640eb2a47dfbe44018e2155","permalink":"https://jmodeler.github.io/post/the-homotopy-principle-simple-examples/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-homotopy-principle-simple-examples/","section":"post","summary":"This post presents 2 simple examples of the homotopy principle applied to (fairly easy) linear and nonlinear systems of equations.

Over a very short period, he had completed an impressive portfolio of work projects, and always had something better in the pipeline. I asked him what he did when starting on anything, and he very kindly shared his method to get (most) things done at work (and in life, where applicable). In the following post, anything marked in tomato-red is input from him.\nRyan’s method to do anything in life (abstract version):\nDetermine what is being asked of you (or what you want to achieve). What problem are you trying to solve? Do not fall victim to the XY problem, be very clear about the deliverable expected. Check and re-check (or re-assess, in case this is a personal goal) with your boss/business partner/end goal regularly.\nWith a clear deliverable in mind, now clearly formulate the steps to be taken to get closer to said deliverable\nNow, do you have all the skills/knowledge to do the steps yourself? Great! Make a plan to work on each step and stick to it. Try to make a plan on how much work will be required time wise to progress through each step. This will also help you learn how good (or bad) you are at estimating time/specific tasks. I highly recommend reading this blog post about what to tackle first. He recommends basically making the smallest version of what you need that includes all the component parts. This helps you discover compatibility/integration issues up front that can wreck a project if they’re discovered late.\nIf you see there are gaps in your knowledge, you have two options:\nLearn everything you need to know to plug the knowledge gap (generally terrifying and not recommended) Find someone else who had the same problem and try to replicate what they’ve done. Google is your friend! (generally where I start, using a tracer bullet). Once you’ve found a solution, follow the process outlined in step 3. and make progress on your work. As you keep working on your steps, DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. This will help you do the following:\nIf you need to (or want to) move on to another project, you can hand this over to someone else and easily create a succession plan. If this project is a personal goal, you have a record of what you did. This will serve as a reference when you need to redo something like this in the future. If your memory is anything like mine, it’s not great and you work on a lot. Your own documentation will help you know why you did something. It helps guide others through how to learn a topic. It can serve as a record of what work was done which can be useful as an archive, or for ideas for other work. Was one process a nightmare that you spent half your time on? Maybe that should be tackled next.
