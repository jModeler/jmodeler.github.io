abstract = {This paper provides a step-by-step guide to solving dynamic stochastic games using the homotopy method. The homotopy method facilitates exploring the equilibrium correspondence in a systematic fashion; it is especially useful in games that have multiple equilibria. We discuss the theory of the homotopy method and its implementation and present two detailed examples of dynamic stochastic games that are solved using this method. {\textcopyright}2010 INFORMS.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the application of numerical continuation methods to compute equilibria in a class of static games of incomplete information. Computation of equilibria in such games is usually a challenging task because the sets of equilibria can have complex configurations. The all-solution homotopy approach allows one to use a set of existing path-tracking tools to compute asymptotic approximations to the sets of equilibria at a relatively low computational cost. We provide some results that these tools can provide asymptotically good approximations to sets of equilibria in games. We illustrate our findings using a simple example of an entry game with linear payoffs. We also discuss a possible approach to estimating games with multiple equilibria using a pre-computed set of equilibria.},
