From time to time, I work with `C` code, and I use the `lldb` debugger to step through the code. Recently, after a Mac OS update, I started seeing this error when attempting to start the lldb debugger in terminal:

```
$ lldb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/15.0.7_1/libexec/python3.11/site-packages/lldb/__init__.py", line 96, in <module>
    import six
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'six'
```

The error message says that a module (`six`) is missing. The other issue, is that this module is missing on a version of python that is _not_ the global version set by `pyenv`. I check the versions of pyenv on my system:

```
$ pyenv versions
  system
* 3.8.16 (set by /Users/<username>/.pyenv/version)
  3.9.1
  3.11.2
```

I'm guessing `lldb` uses the `system` version of Python. A simple `pip3 install six` will not fix the issue, since this will install this package for Python `3.8.16`, instead of the `system` version. I now use `pyenv` to set the local version of python to `system`:

```
$ pyenv local system
$ pyenv versions
* system (set by /Users/sandeep/.python-version)
  3.8.16
  3.9.1
  3.11.2
```

I now install `six`:

```
$ pip3 install six
Collecting six
  Using cached six-1.16.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (11 kB)
Installing collected packages: six
Successfully installed six-1.16.0
```

And I try launching `lldb` on terminal again:

```
% lldb
(lldb)
```

.. which takes me to the `(lldb)` prompt without any issues. 

Make sure you "reset" the default python version to be used to the version you had before (in my case this would be version `3.8.16`)
