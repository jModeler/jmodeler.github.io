**TL;DR:** I need to install the [NVlabs imaginaire package](https://github.com/NVlabs/imaginaire) for a project (more details in a later post). I walk through the installation steps and how to resolve any errors you might encounter.

  1. I need to install the [NVlabs imaginaire package](https://github.com/NVlabs/imaginaire), I follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/imaginaire/blob/master/INSTALL.md). I'm reproducing the commands used in the terminal below:
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/nvlabs/imaginaire
  cd imaginaire
  bash scripts/install.sh
  bash scripts/test_training.sh
  ```
