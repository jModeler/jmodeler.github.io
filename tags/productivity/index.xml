Over a very short period, he had completed an impressive portfolio of work projects, and always had something better in the pipeline. I asked him what he did when starting on anything, and he very kindly shared his method to get (most) things done at work (and in life, where applicable). In the following post, anything &lt;strong>bold&lt;/strong> is input from him.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
