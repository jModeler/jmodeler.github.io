While approximating integrals with MC methods are simpler to implement, they might lead to integral values with considerable simulation error (Skrainka and Judd 2011). This post attempts to demonstrate the claim in Skrainka and Judd (2011) using two very simple integrals, to which we already know the value.</description></item><item><title>The Homotopy Principle: Simple Examples</title><link>http://jmodeler.github.io/posts/the-homotopy-principle-simple-examples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jmodeler.github.io/posts/the-homotopy-principle-simple-examples/</guid><description>This post presents 2 simple examples of the homotopy principle applied to (fairly easy) linear and nonlinear systems of equations. At a very abstract level, given a system of equations for which a solution is needed, we convert this system to one whose solution we already know (or is easy to find out), and then bend this system till we get the solution to the original set of equations. These methods have very broad applications (Garcia and Zangwill 1981), and have been applied in the context of finding equlibria in Static Games (Bajari et al.</description></item></channel></rss>
