In this post, I derive the distribution of the negative of a normally distributed random variable. Let's say we have $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and we want to find the distribution of $Y=-X$.

I start with the identity:

\begin{align}
  P(Y \le y) = P(-X \le y) = P(X \ge -y) = 1 - P(X \le -y)
\end{align}
